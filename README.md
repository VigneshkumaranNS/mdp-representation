### Problem Description
We are developing a temperature control system that acts as an intelligent agent within a room. The system's primary goal is to maintain the room temperature within a designated comfort range, avoiding extremes of cold or discomfort. The room's temperature can be categorized into three states: extreme cold, cold, and comfort. The agent is responsible for monitoring the current temperature and making real-time adjustments to ensure the temperature remains within the comfort zone. The system must adapt to dynamic environmental conditions while balancing energy efficiency.

### State Space
{1,0,2} -{Comfort, Cold, Extreme Cold}
### Sample State
1 {Comfort}
### Action Space
{0,1,2} ={Maintain Temperature, Increase Temperature, Decrease Temperature}

### Sample Action
1 {Increase Temperature}

### Reward Function
+1 if reached the comfort.
0 Other wise.
